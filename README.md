# sqlify - The focused Java SQL library

- Continuous integration: [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/raphaelbauer/sqlify.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/raphaelbauer/sqlify)

Sqlify allows you to run your queries using SQL - the language you already know. 
Sqlify handles query execution and mapping to plain old java objects.

It's a very think layer above jdbc and does not do any magic. Promise.
